# odin-landingpage

this project consists in building a simple landing page from scratch, consolidating the knowledge acquired on HTML and CSS (in particular on flexbox).

In the "reference images" folder there is an image of how the landing page must be at the end of the project (it is not important that it is the same pixel by pixel, but it must be as similar as possible)
